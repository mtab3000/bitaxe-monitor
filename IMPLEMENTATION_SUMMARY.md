# Enhanced Variance Monitoring - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Feature Request Completed

**Original Request:**
> "feature requests monitoring: differ in variance positive and negative deviation. track variance 60s, 300s, 600s and persist the data and make it permanently viewable. show on variance the expected hashrate as base in middle of graph, so you can track positive and negative deviation accordingly over time."

- ✅ 300-second window variance 
- ✅ 600-second window variance
- ✅ All windows calculated simultaneously

#### 3. **Persistent Data Storage** ✅
- ✅ Enhanced CSV logging with variance fields
- ✅ SQLite database for analytics
- ✅ Permanent data retention
- ✅ Daily summaries generation

#### 4. **Expected Hashrate Baseline** ✅
- ✅ Automatic calculation based on ASIC model + frequency
- ✅ Manual override support
- ✅ Visual baseline in variance charts
- ✅ Positive/negative deviation tracking relative to baseline

#### 5. **Enhanced Visualization** ✅
- ✅ Directional variance charts

hashrate_positive_variance_600s    # Positive variance over 600s
hashrate_negative_variance_60s     # Negative variance over 60s
hashrate_negative_variance_300s    # Negative variance over 300s
hashrate_negative_variance_600s    # Negative variance over 600s
hashrate_avg_deviation_60s         # Average deviation over 60s
hashrate_avg_deviation_300s        # Average deviation over 300s
hashrate_avg_deviation_600s        # Average deviation over 600s
```

### Web Interface Enhancements
- **Enhanced Variance Analytics Dashboard**
- **Stability Scoring (0-100 scale)**
- **Color-coded variance cards**
- **Interactive variance reports**
- **Directional variance charts with baseline**

## 🔧 API Endpoints Added

```
GET /api/variance/summary              # All miners variance summary
GET /api/variance/analytics/<miner>    # Detailed variance analytics
GET /api/variance/report/<miner>       # Generate variance report
```

## 📈 Variance Chart Features

### Directional Variance Chart
- **Gray dashed line**: Expected hashrate baseline (middle of graph)
- **Blue line**: Actual hashrate
- **Green area**: Positive deviation zone (performance above expected)
- **Red area**: Negative deviation zone (performance below expected)
- **Real-time updates**: Every 5 seconds

## 🎯 Validation Results

All tests passed successfully:
```

```

## 📁 Files Modified/Added

### Modified Files
- `src/bitaxe_monitor.py` - Enhanced with variance tracking
- Main CSV now includes 9 additional variance fields

### New Files
- `src/variance_persistence.py` - Dedicated variance data storage
- `src/variance_dashboard.py` - Dashboard HTML components
- `test_variance_features.py` - Validation test suite
- `VARIANCE_MONITORING_README.md` - Complete documentation

## 🔍 How to Verify Implementation

### 1. Run Validation Test
```bash
python test_variance_features.py
# Should show: [PASS] ALL TESTS PASSED
```

### 2. Check Data Files
- Look for variance fields in CSV output
- Verify `data/variance_tracking.csv` is created
- Confirm SQLite database `data/variance_analytics.db` exists

### 3. Web Interface Test
- Start monitor
- Open http://localhost:8080
- Click "Show Enhanced Variance Analytics"
- Verify variance cards and charts display

### 4. API Test
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/variance/summary
# Should return JSON with variance data
```

## 📊 Example Variance Data

### Stability Score Interpretation
- **90-100**: Excellent stability 🟢
- **80-89**: Good stability 🟡
- **70-79**: Medium stability 🟠
- **Below 70**: Poor stability 🔴

### Variance Thresholds
