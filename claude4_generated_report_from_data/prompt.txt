Setup & Data Sources:
i have been running this benchmark against my 3 miners: https://github.com/mtab3000/Bitaxe-Hashrate-Benchmark
a nice sample report according to landscapes and heatmaps also provided. pls take the visuals as a template.

miner1: 192.168.1.45
miner2: 192.168.1.46
miner3: 192.168.1.47

i also monitored in parallel the data via: https://github.com/mtab3000/bitaxe-monitor
all result files provided here

monitoring data must be processed and taken into account.

dont confuse set voltage with actual measured voltage. this results in voltage drop.

the miners are all running always in parallel. so make recommendations accordingly. i always need all 3 miners in comparison.
it makes no sense to designate champions regarding topics. always all needed in comparison for all three miners.
show always also the variance in % for each setting.


Problem:
i want to identify the best settings set voltage and set frequency for each miner regarding
three priorized / weighted categories:
1. most important: variance (lower better) + stability (higher better) of hashrate
2. very important: efficency (higher better) + energy consumption (lower J/THs better)
3. less important: max performance hashrate

pls check correlation of all metrics to efficency + stability of hashrate.
cooling is no problem.

conclusion:
so i am looking for a setting for: stable hashrate with very low variance and high efficency, max hashrate.

Other thoughts:
pls also take into consideration the voltage drop and analyze the effects on stability of hashrate / variance.
ideal settings seem to be around 1.000 V actual voltage measured on the asic for stability and efficency. pls check this assumption. pls check each miner individually for best actual voltage.

assumption:
miner 1 & 2 run most stable + efficient at 1.000V
miner3 runs most stable and efficient on 1.030V

Data Quality:
also eliminate the 4 most variant metrics for each set of frequency + voltage for each miner to normalize the data from monitoring https://github.com/mtab3000/bitaxe-monitor.
the miners are also always restarted, when new voltage or frequency are set. remove also these invalid metrics from data.
